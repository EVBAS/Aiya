The kitchen stinks . __eou__ I'll throw out the garbage . __eou__
So Dick , how about getting some coffee for tonight ? __eou__ Coffee ? I don ’ t honestly like that kind of stuff . __eou__ Come on , you can at least try a little , besides your cigarette . __eou__ What ’ s wrong with that ? Cigarette is the thing I go crazy for . __eou__ Not for me , Dick . __eou__
Are things still going badly with your houseguest ? __eou__ Getting worse . Now he ’ s eating me out of house and home . I ’ Ve tried talking to him but it all goes in one ear and out the other . He makes himself at home , which is fine . But what really gets me is that yesterday he walked into the living room in the raw and I had company over ! That was the last straw . __eou__ Leo , I really think you ’ re beating around the bush with this guy . I know he used to be your best friend in college , but I really think it ’ s time to lay down the law . __eou__ You ’ re right . Everything is probably going to come to a head tonight . I ’ ll keep you informed . __eou__
Would you mind waiting a while ? __eou__ Well , how long will it be ? __eou__ I'm not sure . But I'll get a table ready as fast as I can . __eou__ OK . We'll wait . __eou__

Didn ’ t you think it was fun ? ! __eou__ Oh , yeah ! I had a blast ! I love sweating like a pig with a bunch of pot bellies who all smell bad . Sorry , I ’ m just not into this health kick . __eou__ Oh , no , get off it . It wasn ’ t such a killer class . You just have to get into it . Like they say , no pain , no gain . __eou__ I am wiped out . Thank you . __eou__ Look , next time get yourself some comfy shoes . You ’ re gonna come back again with me , aren ’ t you ? __eou__ Never ! But thank you for inviting me . __eou__ Come on . You ’ ll feel better after we hit the showers . __eou__

Can you manage chopsticks ? __eou__ Why not ? See . __eou__ Good mastery . How do you like our Chinese food ? __eou__ Oh , great ! It's delicious . You see , I am already putting on weight . There is one thing I don't like however , MSG . __eou__ What's wrong with MSG ? It helps to bring out the taste of the food . __eou__ According to some studies it may cause cancer . __eou__ Oh , don't let that worry you . If that were true , China wouldn't have such a large population . __eou__ I just happen to have a question for you guys . Why do the Chinese cook the vegetables ? You see what I mean is that most vitamin are destroyed when heated . __eou__ I don't know exactly . It's a tradition . Maybe it's for sanitary reasons . __eou__
I'm exhausted . __eou__ Okay , let's go home . __eou__

Have you got any better ? __eou__ That's the best there is . __eou__ Okay , I'll take one . __eou__ That'll be $ 200 , sir . __eou__
Let me help you with that . __eou__ Thanks very much . __eou__ You really shouldn't be lifting this by yourself . __eou__ I know , but there was nobody else . __eou__

The program is especially for the beginners like us . __eou__ Really ? When is it on ? __eou__ It begins at 6:40 every morning , and it goes for 20 minutes . __eou__ Thank you so much . I'll try and catch that . __eou__ The radio has brought us lots of convenience . __eou__ Yes , I can also learn about the traffic condition through it . __eou__ With the development of the society and technology , radio is nearly everywhere . __eou__ So we should take the advantage of it . __eou__
Do you have these shoes in a size 7 ? __eou__ Yes . Let me get you a pair . __eou__

May I speak to Peter ? __eou__ Who's calling ? __eou__
It's so boring . __eou__ Don't you like it ? __eou__ I don't . Is there anything worth watching on the other channel ? __eou__ I think it's a basketball match on channel 5 . __eou__ Do you mind if we switch over ? __eou__ Well , I'd rather see a movie . __eou__ What's the movie ? __eou__ ' Star war ' . __eou__ It must be interesting . __eou__ Yes , you're right . __eou__
Excuse me , what's the screen near your steering wheel for ? __eou__ It's a portable TV . It's a popular thing now . __eou__ Oh , that's new to me . So what's on everyday ? __eou__ News about current affairs , documentaries , music , movies , noncommercial ads and so on . __eou__ Is there anything interesting ? __eou__ Yes , there are something good and informative . I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education . __eou__ I agree . Are there any commercials on the TV ? __eou__ Of course . Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs . __eou__ That makes a lot of sense . Does the TV work well ? __eou__ Not always . It depends on the transmission of the satellite signals . __eou__ I got it . Do you pay for the programs ? __eou__ Yes , 50 Yuan per month . __eou__ It is a little bit expensive , but it's worth it . __eou__ Yeah . You know driving is boring . TV can get me out of the fatigue of driving . __eou__ It can also entertain your passengers like me . __eou__ That's the point . __eou__
Jenny , you're too lazy . You should do some exercise . See , you're getting fat . __eou__ Dad , it's raining outside . __eou__ That is your excuse . __eou__ All right , all right , I will go swimming with Peter this afternoon . __eou__ Not just today . Go exercise everyday ! __eou__

Hi , who has the remote control ? __eou__ I do . Why , do you want me to change the channel ? __eou__ Yes , please . I can't stand watching the channel any more . __eou__ I think they have pretty good programmes . But I'll change it if you really want . __eou__ Put it on Channel 5 , OK ? __eou__ Oh , I hate Channel 5 . I'd rather just listen to the radio . __eou__ Don't make such a fuss . I'm sure you will like today's programme . __eou__ What's on today ? __eou__ A basketball match between Chinese team and American team . __eou__ Really ? I'm interested in it . __eou__ It might begin now . __eou__
Peter , where are you going ? __eou__ I'm going to do some shopping . __eou__ Won't you watch TV ? __eou__ What's on TV tonight ? Is there a football match ? __eou__ The TV station will air the World Cup football match alive at 8: 30 . __eou__ Really ? Who will play ? __eou__ The Brazilian team versus the American team . Don't miss it . __eou__ That's cool . I'll watch it . __eou__ Who do you think will win ? __eou__ There is no doubt that the Brazilian team will win . __eou__ I think so . __eou__
May I have a cookie ? __eou__ Help yourself . __eou__
By the way , where's Jim ? __eou__ He is out . __eou__
Watch out ! __eou__ Wow ! That car almost hit me . __eou__
Eat some more . __eou__ No , thanks . I'm on a diet . __eou__
Hurry up , will you ? __eou__ What's the rush ? __eou__
Kata ! You've got a beautiful singing voice . You hit the high notes perfectly . __eou__ Thank you for your compliment . But you are exaggerating . I think you are destined to be a singer . You have the best voice ! __eou__ Thank you . Maybe we can sing a song together . Would you like to sing with me ? __eou__ Yes , I'd like to . It's my honor . Let's pick a song . __eou__ How about this one ? __eou__ Sorry , I can't sing the song . __eou__ Er ... How about this one ? __eou__ OK . But I'm not familiar . I don't know the beginning part . __eou__ Never mind . You can follow me . I'll sing the first part . __eou__ OK . __eou__
Peter , go and tidy up your toys now . __eou__ Wait a moment , mom . __eou__ I'm mad ! I said now ! Turn off the TV , and do it now . __eou__ Mom , just ten more minutes . The show is going to be over soon . __eou__ Peter , if you don't do it soon , I will throw your toys in the trash can . __eou__
Sorry , I'm late . __eou__ It doesn't matter . __eou__
Excuse me , I've been waiting here for 10 minutes . Do you know how often does No . 636 run ? __eou__ It runs every 15 minutes . You must have missed it . __eou__ It seems you got here at good time . Do you have a bus schedule ? __eou__ Yes , I do . You can buy a bus schedule in a news stand . __eou__ I see , thank you . By the way , is this the right bus for the Museum ? __eou__ Yes , it is . __eou__ Do I have to change ? __eou__ No . The Museum is the terminal of this bus . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__ You are welcome . __eou__
Mom , can I have more allowance ? __eou__ What for ? __eou__ I want to buy more books . __eou__ Oh , yeah ? Are you joking ? __eou__ Of course not ! I'm telling the truth . __eou__ Honey , it's good if you spend money to buy more books . But $ 100 dollars a week is enough for you already . __eou__
Two burgers , please . __eou__ For here or to go ? __eou__
Dad , may I have a room of my own ? __eou__ Oh , honey , I'm so sorry , we don't have enough space for you to have your own room . __eou__ Dad , but I don't want to share a room with Peter . He snores every night . __eou__ Honey , you can ask him to be quite . Otherwise you may punish him and tell him to stand out of the room , right ? __eou__ Alright . Maybe it's the only way to do it . __eou__
Open the book and turn to page 10 . __eou__ It is difficult . __eou__ No , honey , it's easy if you know the way . __eou__ Do I have to memorize it ? __eou__ No , honey , try to make notes in your notebook . __eou__
Peter , wash your hands first , and then have some dessert . __eou__ Mom , can I have some ice cream ? __eou__ Not today , Honey . Don't eat too much ice cream . __eou__ Mom , can I have one more piece of cake ? __eou__ Ok . The last piece is for your dessert . We're having dinner soon . __eou__
Dad , can you help me ? __eou__ Oh , honey , you made a mistake . __eou__ I don't know how to do it . __eou__ OK . Let's do it together . __eou__ 16 divided by 2 . What's the answer ? __eou__ 16 divided by 2 equals 8 . __eou__ You got it . Good job . __eou__
How was your test ? __eou__ It was bad . __eou__ Oh , honey , you should study harder . __eou__ But I already tried my best . __eou__ Don't worry . You'll do better next time . __eou__
Is Bob home ? __eou__ Sorry . You've got the wrong number . __eou__
Dad , how do you say this word ? __eou__ Sword , say it ' sword ' . __eou__ What does this word mean ? __eou__ Look it up in the dictionary . __eou__ Dad , can you just tell me what it means ? I'm too lazy . __eou__ No , honey , go and read it . You'll learn . __eou__
Jenny , what's your favorite color ? __eou__ I like red . __eou__ Now , we're going to draw an apple in your sketch book . What do we use ? __eou__ Dad , I want to draw with crayons , can I ? __eou__ Why not ? Let's draw the outline of an apple with your pencil first . __eou__
Mom , my nose is bleeding . __eou__ What happened , Peter ? Did you have a fight ? __eou__ No , mom . I didn't . __eou__ Did somebody hit you ? Or did you just fall ? __eou__ Mom ! I was just picking my nose , and now it's bleeding . __eou__
Something's wrong with my air conditioning . __eou__ Leave it to me . I'll fix it . __eou__
Mom , I don't feel well . __eou__ Are you sick ? __eou__ I feel dizzy . __eou__ Let me take your temperature . __eou__ Mom , I don't want to go to see a doctor . __eou__ Oh , honey , I think you've caught a cold , you should get a shot . __eou__
What do you want to be ? __eou__ Dad , I haven't thought about it . I'm still young . __eou__ Oh , honey , but you must know what your hobby is , right ? __eou__ I like playing the piano . __eou__ Yes , you play the piano well . You could be a good pianist . That's good . __eou__

May I have the menu , please ? __eou__ Sure . Here you go . __eou__
Peter , do you want to learn to play the piano ? __eou__ No , mom . Piano is for girls . __eou__ Well , there are many boys that can play the piano very well , like Jay Chou . __eou__ No way , mom . I don't like piano . __eou__ OK . But you have to promise me that you will study hard in your English class . __eou__ All right , all right . I understand . __eou__
Jenny , Can you come and help me ? __eou__ Mom , what should I do ? __eou__ It's dusty everywhere in the house . Can you help me do the housecleaning ? __eou__ OK . I will call Peter to clean it together . __eou__ That's my good girl . The clothes need washing . I'll do the laundry . __eou__
Mom , what are we going to make tonight ? __eou__ Curry and rice . What do you think ? __eou__ That sounds nice . I can peel the potatoes first . __eou__ Really ! Oh , honey , you are so sweet .

Can you make out what he's saying ? __eou__ No , it's too loud in here . __eou__
It's your turn now , Helen . __eou__ OK . I'm coming . __eou__ This is your song . I picked it for you . __eou__ Thank you .

Let me have a try ... __eou__ Well done ! I hope I can sing as well as you one day . __eou__ Thank you . I'm sure you will . __eou__ I hope so . Thank you for saying so . __eou__
Dinner's ready ! Come and get it ! __eou__ Coming ! __eou__
Have you got a minute ? __eou__ Sure . What's up ? __eou__
Who is the next one ? __eou__ It's Peter's turn . __eou__ Give the mike to him . __eou__ OK . __eou__ Be quiet . He is singing . __eou__ I thought he only liked to listen ! __eou__ So did I . __eou__ He has a really good voice ! __eou__ Yes , he sings wonderfully . __eou__
Can you pass me the lighter ? __eou__ Here . Catch ! __eou__
Have you ever sung with a karaoke ? __eou__ Yes , I do it quite often . __eou__ Karaoke has become a major entertainment . I wonder why . __eou__ Simple , it's fun . __eou__ How much fun is there in singing in front of other people , especially if you don't sing well ? __eou__ Ah , that's the biggest fun of all . You see , even though you're not a good singer , people will listen to you . __eou__ I wouldn't do that . __eou__ But I like the feeling . __eou__
What kind of music do you like ? __eou__ I like popular music best . __eou__ Me too . __eou__ Who is your favorite singer ? __eou__ Qi In is . __eou__ Do you know this song ? __eou__ Yes , I like it very much . __eou__ Let's sing it together , shall we ? __eou__ No problem . __eou__
Who's it for ? __eou__ It's for you . __eou__
How much does this cost ? __eou__ Sixty dollars . __eou__
May I use your phone ? __eou__ Go ahead . __eou__
Where's the toilet ? __eou__ Over there . __eou__
Watch out , Jenny ! Be careful of the cars . __eou__ I'm fine , dad . __eou__ Did you get hit ? __eou__ No , dad . Can I go there to play ball ? __eou__ Watch out for strangers , and don't go too far away . Alright ? __eou__
Do you shop online often ? __eou__ Every so often . It is very convenient and the price is lower than in stores . __eou__ Are there many things online ? __eou__ Books , cosmetics , daily necessities , even large electrical appliance can be ordered from online-stores . __eou__ Incredible . I really want to survey the on-line virtual supermarket . __eou__ Even you can bargain with the owner of one on-line store , although he or she provides ' But It Now ' prices . __eou__ What are the disadvantages of on-line shopping ? __eou__ Some provide wrong pictures for the goods , so many buyers are deceived . __eou__
Peter , it's time to go home now ! Hurry up ! __eou__ Ten more minutes , mom . Please ! __eou__ Honey , it's almost noon . We have to go home and make lunch for your sister . __eou__ I bet she will hang around with her mates after school . __eou__ Peter , it's a quarter to twelve . Let's go home now ! __eou__
Don't tell me you're pregnant again . __eou__ I'm afraid so . __eou__
I am keen on a coat on www.dingding.com . But it requires having an online banking account . Is it necessary ? __eou__ Indeed . Online banking enables you to make on-line shopping . __eou__ Do you know how to get the bank account ? __eou__ Bring your ID card and fill out a form . That will be fine . __eou__ So easy . __eou__ I think online banking can change your money habits and it is quicker than ATM processing speed . __eou__ My shopping life will be more convenient . __eou__
Honey , I need to have a talk with you . __eou__ Dad , I have to do my homework . __eou__ No , honey , why didn't you go to cram school last night ? __eou__ Dad , I don't want to talk about it now . __eou__ Honey , if you don't want to go to cram school , you should tell me the reason why . __eou__ I'm sorry , dad . But I would rather stay at school than go to cram school . __eou__
Do you have any plan to buy a house in this city ? __eou__ Absolutely we need a house here . But what makes me upset is the prices in this city . __eou__ Our monthly salary can not buy one square meter of the house here . __eou__ It is depressing to hear the price goes higher and higher . __eou__ More and more people need to buy houses , but the market can not meet the needs , so this caused the bubble in real estate industry . __eou__ And the rich still wants to buy more , even though they have at least one house to live . __eou__ Have you watched the TV series , Humble Abode ? __eou__ Yes , it displays some social problems and interprets the values of our white-collars . __eou__ I really , really want a house , even though it is small like a snail house . __eou__
Stop burping . __eou__ I can't help it . __eou__
Can you give me a hand ? __eou__ Of course . __eou__
