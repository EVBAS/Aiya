      "The movies .",
      "Sure . Here you go .",
      "No , mom . Piano is for girls .",
      "Mom , what should I do ?",
      "Curry and rice . What do you think ?",
      "No , it's too loud in here .",

      "It is so popular among people to preserve health now , so I read some books about health food .",
      "What do we have for the dinner now ?",
      "Take a guess .",
      "Honey , don't tell me that you want a pet dog also .",
      "I don't know yet . What's your idea , Dad ?",
      "Well , what game do you want to play ?",
